Difference between this and super keyword
Also, difference between this() and super() method calls 

The keywords super is used to access/call the parent class members (variables and methods)
The keyword this is used to call the current class members (variables and methods). This is requred when we have 
a parameter with the same name as an instance variable (field) 

Note: we can use them both anywhere in the class except static areas. 

<<<<KEYWORD THIS >>>>>>

Keyword this is commonly used with constructors and setters, and optionally in getters

<<<Keyword Super >>>>

The keyword super is commonly used with method overriding, when we call a method with the same name from the parent class.

Difference between this and super keyword
Also, difference between this() and super() method calls 

The keywords super is used to access/call the parent class members (variables and methods)
The keyword this is used to call the current class members (variables and methods). This is requred when we have 
a parameter with the same name as an instance variable (field) 

Note: we can use them both anywhere in the class except static areas. 

<<<<KEYWORD THIS >>>>>>

Keyword this is commonly used with constructors and setters, and optionally in getters

<<<Keyword Super >>>>

The keyword super is commonly used with method overriding, when we call a method with the same name from the parent class.


In java we have this() AND super() call. Notice the braces, it is known as a call since it looks like a regular method call. 
Use this() to call a constructor from another overloaded constructor in the same class. 
The call to this() can be used only in constructor, and it must be the first statement in a constructor. It's used with constructor chaining
in other words, when one constructor calls another, and it helps to reduce duplicated code. 
the only way to call a parent constructor is is by calling super(). This calls the parent constructor. 

The java compiler puts a default call to super() if we don't add it, and it's always the noargs super which is inserted by compiler (constructor without arguments)
The call to super must be the first statement in each constructor. 

NOTE: a constructor can have a call to this() or super() but never both.

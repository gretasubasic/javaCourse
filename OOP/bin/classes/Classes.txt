Objects are similar to real life objects. They have state and behaviour. 
Software objects store it's state in fields and we know fields as variables and they expose behaviour
with methods. 
So, where do classes fit in?
Let's think of the class as the template or blueprint for creating objects. 
We have seen the classes before. 
----> public class Main is the statement that creates a new class in Java!

Why do we need to bother with classes? What benefits do classes give us?

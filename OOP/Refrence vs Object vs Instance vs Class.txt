<CLASS>

A class is basically a blueprint for a house, using a blueprint (plan) we can build as many houses as we want
based on those plans (blueprint)

Each house you build (in other words an instantiate using the new operator) is an object also 
known an an INSTANCE!

Each house you build has an address (a physical location). In other words, if you want to tell someone where you live
you give them your address (perhaps written on paper). This is known as a reference.

You can copy that reference as many times as you like but there is still just one house. In other words,
we are copying the paper that has address on it, not the house itself.


We can pass references as parameters to constructors and methods.
